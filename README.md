Discord Bot

## What is Discord?
Discord is a voice chat application similar to Slacks where users are allowed to create their own servers and invite friends to chat.

## Approach
For this project, I used Node.js to connect to the Discord API and access the necessary functionality to host a bot application. For the music functionality, I used Youtube's API to download and reproduce playlists inside voice chat channels. The list of all commands are available to any user that types !commands via private message.

## Deployment
For this project, I used Amazon's EC2 web service to upload and deploy the application. As of August 2018, the application is no longer being deployed.

## What did I learn?
I learned to use Node.js in a backend application that needed different APIs to perform basic functionality. I also learned how to deploy an application via Amazon EC2.
